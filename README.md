# Road-Accident-PowerBi-Dashboard

## Objective
The aim of this project was to analyze road accident data and create an interactive 
dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard helps users understand how, when, and why 
road accidents happen. It is designed for use by government officials, transport planners, 
and safety departments to make better, data-based decisions. 

## Data Preparation
- The dataset was imported into Power BI.
- Basic cleaning was done: missing or incorrect values were either fixed or removed.
- Important columns like Date of Accident, Severity, Weather, Junction Type, and Road 
Surface Conditions were formatted properly.
- Unwanted or repeated values were cleaned to improve the accuracy of visuals.

## Dashboard Features 
Here are the main insights shown in the dashboard: 
- Accident Severity: Shows how many accidents were minor, serious, or fatal.
- Accidents Over Time: Line chart that shows trends in accidents month-wise or year
wise. 
- Day of the Week: Bar chart that shows which days have more accidents. 
- Junction Control: Highlights which junction types (like traffic signals or roundabouts) 
are more accident-prone. 
- Weather Conditions: Shows how rain, fog, or clear weather affect accident severity. 
- Road Surface Conditions: Compares accident severity on dry, wet, or icy roads.
